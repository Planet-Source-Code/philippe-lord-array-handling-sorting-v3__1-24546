## Array\-handling/sorting v3


</div>

### Description

Well, this is v3 of my previous post. It contains 68 functions that are related to sorting, searching, hashing, moving, copying, adding, deleting arrays (+ some more :). Anyway, I think you get the idea. All possible speed enhancement have been implanted, including LOTS of CopyMemory. Each functions have been vigorously tested AND benchmarked for efficiency.

The major new feature is a new sort algorithm, dubbed 'TriQuickSort'. I am aware that no sort algorithms are the fastest in all case, but I can affirm you that this one performs *very* well. It is about as fast as QuickSort, but does not suffer from nearly-sorted arrays. In many cases it can be even faster than QuickSort because it combines 2 sort algorithms, so that the major drawback of QuickSort gets done by another sort algorithm (InsertionSort). Anyway, on my previous post i had 4x 5 stars, so you guys should enjoy the newest version :)
 
### More Info
 
This module assumes arrays are zero based. Get prepared for VB.NET and start taking good programming habits.
